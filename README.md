# Photo Tagging app

## What is this?

This is an exercise for the javascript course on The Odin Project. It's practice to understand better the following topics:

- React (Hooks, State Management)
- CSS
- HTML

## Tools

- Chakra UI (amazing)

## Notes

- Had a lot of trouble uploading, because of React Router. Switched to Hash Router and all good.

## Where can I play it?
